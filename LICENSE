GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
you to deprive others of these rights. Therefore, you also need to
accept the consequences of your actions.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
free or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to use the software.

For the developers’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified
versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be
attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some people disapprove of the GPL for various reasons, including
the belief that it is too strict for their needs. But the authors of
the GPL have thought carefully about this, and have decided to
afford the rights to all users. Therefore, the GPL is a good fit for
many projects, and is the license most used by free software.

			TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
types of works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients"
may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of it,
thus making a corrected or improved version. A "modified version"
is a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either copied
verbatim, or with modifications.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a modified
version. A "combined work" is a work produced by combining or linking
another work with the Program or a covered work.  The terms "you"
and "your" refer to the licensee of the covered work, and the terms
"me" and "my" refer to the copyright holder.

"Propagate" means to make a copy of a covered work with or without
modifications, thus conveying it to another. A "conveyor" is someone
who propagates or distributes the work to others.

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

1. Source Code.

The Program must include a copy of this License. If the Program is
conveyed in object code form, you must include a copy of the
License along with the object code. You may not impose any further
restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed
under this License. You must keep intact all notices stating that
this License applies to the Program, and all notices of the absence
of any warranty; and you must give all recipients a copy of this
License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
but you may not charge a fee for the Program itself. However, you
may offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

If you convey a covered work, you must keep intact all notices
stating that this License applies to the work, and all notices of
the absence of any warranty; and you must give all recipients a
copy of this License along with the work.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. You must keep intact
all notices stating that this License applies to the Program, and
all notices of the absence of any warranty; and you must give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

2. Modified Versions.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program. You may copy and
convey such modifications under the terms of section 1 above, provided
that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause the modified work to be licensed as a whole
  at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

3. Copyleft.

You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who distributes the Program or a modified version. You may
not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License.

4. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 1 and 2 above, provided that you also do one of the following:

  a) Accompany it with the corresponding source code, which must be
  included in the same physical or virtual package as the object code.

  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of
the corresponding source code, or (2) access to copy the source code
from a designated location. The source code must be available for
no more than the cost of distribution of the object code.

5. Combination of this License with Other Licenses.

You may combine the work with other works, and convey the resulting
combination under terms of your choice, provided that you follow
the requirements of this License for the Program.

6. Additional Terms.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. You may not impose
any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or
affirmed under this License. You must keep intact all notices
stating that this License applies to the Program, and all notices
of the absence of any warranty; and you must give all recipients a
copy of this License along with the Program.

7. Termination.

You have no other rights, except those that are granted under this
License. If you violate the terms of this License, your rights under
this License terminate automatically.

8. Acceptance Not Required; Automatic License Grants.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
convey the Program or its derivatives. These actions are prohibited
by law if you do not accept this License.

9. Other Versions of This License.

Each version is given the same legal effect. If you wish to
incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
licenses are incompatible, write to the Free Software Foundation.

10. Future Versions.

The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the GNU
General Public License from time to time. Each version will have
its own number, and that number will be distinct from the previous
versions.  You may choose to follow the terms and conditions of
either version.

11. Disclaimer of Warranty.

There is no warranty for the Program, except as explicitly stated
in the License.

12. Limitation of Liability.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies
and conveys the Program, be liable to you for damages, including
any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
out of the use or inability to use the Program (including but not
limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses
sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to
operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

			END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
good to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
this information:

"<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does>"
"Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>"
"This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of
the License, or (at your option) any later version."
"This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details."
"You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."
